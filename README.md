# Bio 

I am a mathematics undergraduate student in the [University of Maryland, College Park, College of Computer Mathematical and Natural Sciences](https://cmns.umd.edu). [Here](info.txt) are the classes I have taken so far. [Here](research.txt) is my research experience so far.

My interests revolve around computational sciences. I am always eager to be able to apply my math background to a problem... especially since I am on the applied math track.
